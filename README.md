# Sky Node-React Project

This project is a full-stack web application built using **Node.js** for the backend and **React** for the frontend.

## Project Overview
This is a simple full-stack application designed to demonstrate the integration of **Node.js** and **React**. It includes features like authentication, user management, and CRUD functionality, making it a great example of a full-stack development workflow.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- **Frontend**: React, HTML, CSS
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token)
- **Other**: Axios (for API calls), dotenv (for managing environment variables)

## Features
- User Authentication (Login & Signup)
- CRUD operations for managing data
- JWT authentication for secure API access
- Responsive user interface built with React
- Environment variables for configuration

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krishnashukla1/sky-node-react-project.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd sky-node-react-project

Install backend dependencies:
cd backend
npm install

Install frontend dependencies:
cd frontend
npm install

Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file in the backend directory.

Add the following variables to .env:
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://your_mongo_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT=5000
===========================
Usage
Start the backend:
cd backend
npm start

Start the frontend:
cd frontend
npm start

The backend should now be running on http://localhost:5000, and the frontend on http://localhost:3000.

Environment Variables
The following environment variables are required for the project:

MONGO_URI: MongoDB Atlas connection string
JWT_SECRET: Secret key for JWT authentication
PORT: Port for the server to run (default is 5000)

### Steps to Customize:

1. **Replace Placeholder Values**: Make sure to replace `your_mongo_connection_string` and `your_jwt_secret_key` with your actual MongoDB URI and JWT secret key.
   
2. **Add Additional Features**: If your project has more specific functionality or extra features, you can add them under the "Features" section.

3. **Project Setup**: If there are any specific instructions for setting up or running your project, you can modify the "Installation" and "Usage" sections accordingly.

Feel free to adjust this as per your projectâ€™s specific requirements!
